## Features

- User-friendly web interface for managing firewall rules
- Real-time monitoring of network traffic
- Integration with iptables for packet filtering
- Express.js server for handling requests

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of iptables for configuring firewall rules.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd basic-firewall
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Express.js server:
   ```
   node server/server.js
   ```

2. Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to access the firewall interface.
3. Use the interface to manage firewall rules and monitor network traffic.
4. Run the `src/scripts/iptables.sh` script to configure iptables as needed.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that the Express.js server is properly secured and configured.
- Regularly update dependencies to avoid security vulnerabilities.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
